# Old from session 1

## 6. Reading Process and Perception

### 6.1. Pre-attentive Perception

- Visual variables support rapid, unconscious discovery of groupings and patterns.[7]
- “Selectivity” relates to perception: some variables (color, size) create instantly distinguishable groups, while others require sequential search.[7]

### 6.2. Cognitive Load

- Bertin aimed for graphics with the “least mental cost”: images readable at a glance, but acknowledged such universality ignores cultural/experiential differences.[5]

## 7. Functional Types of Graphics

### 7.1. Graphic Functions

- **Recording:** Visuals act as storage, often exhaustive and detailed.[1]
- **Communication:** Designed to highlight, simplify, persuade (editorial, presentations).[10][1]
- **Processing/Analysis:** Dynamic or interactive graphics for active reasoning, including the “mobile” Bertin Matrix for pattern-finding.[5]

## 8. Application Examples

### 8.1. Diagrammatic Uses

- Bar/line charts for temporal or categorical progression.
- Matrices for comparing variables and uncovering structure (e.g., Bertin’s reorderable matrices).[5]

### 8.2. Network Uses

- Force-directed graphs for social/political ties.
- Flow diagrams for process and logistics.

### 8.3. Spatial Use (Maps)

- Thematic maps using hue or texture for data distribution.
- “Image-file” arrangements for sorting and exploring spatial patterns.[5]

## 9. Semiotic Theory in Graphics

### 9.1. Signs and Meaning

- **Signifier:** Visual mark/symbol.[11][5]
- **Signified:** The concept/data represented.[11][5]
- Literal (denotation) and cultural/contextual (connotation) meaning may differ.[12][11][5]

### 9.2. Category of Signs

- **Icon:** Resemblance (e.g., shape of a tree for a forest).
- **Index:** Causality/association (e.g., thermometer icon for temperature).
- **Symbol:** Arbitrary or conventional representation (e.g., blue for water).[11]

***

## 10. Critique and Evolution

- Bertin’s work is foundational, yet some properties such as cognitive differences and cultural bias were underexplored.[5]
- Later work in visual analytics, user-centric/cultural semiotics, and digital technology broaden the grammar Bertin established.[3][5]
