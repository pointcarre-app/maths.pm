# Defaults Test

This markdown intentionally provides no relevant metadata fields.
It is used to verify that the PM model sets the following defaults when metadata keys are absent:

- theme → null
- theme_rdb → null
- chapter → null
- chapter_rdb → null
- mode → null
- b_type → "default"
- needs_pen → null

Plain paragraph to ensure there is at least one fragment.
