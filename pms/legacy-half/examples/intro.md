# Introduction to PM Examples

Welcome to the PM (Pedagogical Markdown) rendering system examples!

## What is PM?

PM is a powerful markdown-based content system that allows you to create rich, interactive educational content.

### Key Features

- **Rich Text Formatting**: Full markdown support with extensions
- **Mathematical Expressions**: LaTeX math rendering via MathLive
- **Code Highlighting**: Syntax highlighting with CodeMirror
- **Interactive Elements**: Radio buttons, number inputs, and more
- **Responsive Layouts**: Column layouts and responsive design

## Getting Started

This example demonstrates how PM content is rendered in your application.

### Basic Text

You can write regular markdown text with **bold**, *italic*, and `inline code`.

### Lists

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Code Blocks

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello from PM!")
    return "Welcome to the examples"
```

### Mathematics

You can include mathematical expressions like $E = mc^2$ or display equations:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

## Next Steps

- Explore more examples in the `/examples` directory
- Check the documentation in `/pm/documentation`
- Try creating your own PM files
