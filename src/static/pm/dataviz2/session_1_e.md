# Data Visualization Project



[TOC]



## Groups constitution


Most of the students will be working in groups of 3. If the number of students is not a multiple of 3, we will also form groups of 4 (as few as possible).

## Project data requirements


The dataset must be relevant in order to use the concepts and the different data visualization techniques we will learn during this course.<br>
**The teacher will validate the dataset**

## Grading criteria


- <span>5 points for the substance of the story you will tell</span>
- <span>9 points for the usage of the different concepts and data visualization techniques </span>
- <span>3 points for your proficiency with `matplotlib`</span>
- <span>3 points for your proficiency with `bokeh`</span>


## Deliverable


- <span style="color: green;">A bokeh server application</span> <strong>(this is the recommended option)</strong>
- <span>A notebook with the code and the visualizations</span>
- <span>A one page report of the project</span>



Bokeh server applications seem to be the easiest to implement. Indeed, interactions with JupyterLab (or any browser based environment for execution or rendering) implies implementing by hand the logic of update when using widgets. Therefore, without this very low level logic implementation, bokeh looses some very interesting features.
