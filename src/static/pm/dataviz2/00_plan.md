## An first example from Reuters


![COVID-19 Mortality in the US](files/covid-2timeseries-us-presidency.jpg)

> Can we make bold statements about the time-series of COVID-19 of numbers of deaths in the US ? Do we need more data ?


The complete article from **Reuters** is available [here](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-marks-1-million-americans-dead-covid-2022-05-12/).
To better understand this chart and the conclusion we can draw more, details are provided [here](80_covid_us_stats_analysis.md).


## About this course



### üìù Organizational details

**Teaching Language:** English  
**ECTS Credits:** 1  
**Duration:** 

- 15 hours lectures and tutorials (i.e. $3\\times 5h= 15h$)
- 10 hours personal work  

**Teaching material: *(more details below)***

- *"Slides"*
- Exercises



### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Basics on Python
- (secondary) Fundamental statistics and mathematics
- (secondary) Understanding of data structures (mostly `numpy.arrays`, `pandas.DataFrames`)

**Those two secondary aspects will be presented in the course, but not covered in depth.**



### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies used in this course


**Software:** Python 

**Focus on the libraries:**

- Matplotlib
- Bokeh


### üìä Learning Outcomes

- Notions in graphic semiology to be able to choose the relevant vizualisation. 
- Creation of interactive diagrams, cartographic or otherwise, to represent datasets, in Python.



### üéØ Subjects Covered

> Data visualization is a fundamental ingredient of data science as it ‚Äúforces us to notice what we never expected to see‚Äù in a given dataset. Dataviz is also a tool for communication and, as such, is a visual language. All along the courses, we will focus on methods and strategies to represent datasets, using dynamic and interactive tools.






<!-- 
**üìñ Course Materials:**
- **[Introduction & Interactive Notebooks](01_introduction.md)** - Getting started with Jupyter environments and code fragments
- **[Jupyter Launcher](jupyter_launcher.md)** - Direct access to interactive Python environments -->

### üìù Evaluation
The evaluation consists on a data vizualisation project. The students will have *to build a web site* based on Bokeh library. As this course doesn't include any web development concepts and tools, the student will have will have the right to use a `Jupyter Notebook`. Hence, bokeh interactivity will be avalaible



## Detailed plan and organization of the course

<!-- Precise deilverable -->



### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Session 3: Advanced data vizualisation


Any issue related to the proper execution of code on machine must be solved during this session. **Feel free to ask for help.**
{: .alert .alert-error .alert-soft}

Each group must have selected a dataset and a project scope during hour 3.
{: .alert .alert-warning .alert-soft}

It's good practice to think about the story you want to tell with your data. Combined with the characteristics of your data, **this will help you to choose the relevant graph types.**

Even though data modeling is not the scope of this course, prelaminary knowledge of the correlations and or causations and *"forces at play"* can help a lot to build story statistically defended.
