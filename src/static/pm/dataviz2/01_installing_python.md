## Why installing `Pyenv` ?

> `pyenv` is a tool to manage multiple Python versions, while maintaining a consistent and clean installation process. The source code is available [here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

**Kind remainder**: it's always a bad idea to interact with the system Python version. Python is used by most of the OS, updating some libraries (or any other operation)might break the system.
